				<h2>Definitions</h2>
				<p>‘Nonpersonal Data’ (NPD) is any information that is in no way personally identifiable. Some NPD is obtained automatically when you access our website with a web browser. ‘Personal Data’ (PD) is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. PD is in many ways the same as Personally Identifiable Information (PII). However, PD is broader in scope and covers more data.</p>
